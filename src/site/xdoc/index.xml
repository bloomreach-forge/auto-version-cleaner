      <subsection name="What is BloomReach Version History Cleaner?">
        <p>
          BloomReach Version History Cleaner provides the following features:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            On document publication, it can remove surplus versions or older versions
            <i>automatically</i> based on configurations.
            See <a href="config.html">Configuration</a> page for details.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="alert alert-info">
          <p>
            Some versions are used to keep internal branching metadata; technically the versions for the branching
            metadata contains multiple version labels.
            That kind of versions are excluded in the version history cleanup process.
          </p>
        </div>

      <subsection name="Running Demo Project">
        <p>
          You can run the demo project like the following:
        </p>
        <div class="brush: bash">
          <source><![CDATA[
$ mvn clean install
$ cd demo
$ mvn clean verify && mvn -Pcargo.run
          ]]></source>
        </div>
        <p>
          The demo project is configured with <code>default.max.revisions: 3</code>.
          So, if you edit and re-publish a document more than three times, you will notice the older versions
          being removed automatically in order to keep only 3 versions in history.
        </p>
