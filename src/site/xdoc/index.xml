      <subsection name="What is BloomReach Version History Cleaner?">
        <p>
          BloomReach Version History Cleaner provides the following features:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            On document publication, it can remove surplus versions or older versions
            <i>automatically</i> based on configurations.
            See <a href="config.html">Configuration</a> page for details.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="alert alert-info">
          <p>
            Some versions are used to keep internal branching metadata; technically the versions for the branching
            metadata contains multiple version labels.
            That kind of versions are excluded in the version history cleanup process.
          </p>
        </div>

      <subsection name="Running Demo Project">
        <p>
          You can run the demo project like the following:
        </p>
        <div class="brush: bash">
          <source><![CDATA[
$ mvn clean install
$ cd demo
$ mvn clean verify && mvn -Pcargo.run
          ]]></source>
        </div>
        <p>
          The demo project is configured like the following.
          So, if you edit and re-publish any documents more than three times, other than <strong>Events</strong>
          documents, then you will notice the older versions being removed automatically in order to keep only 3
          versions in the version history.
          But, it will keep only up to 2 versions for <strong>Events</strong> documents.
          Also, it will truncate the archived nodes and all the versions when a document is deleted
          due to the configuration: <code>default.truncate.ondelete: true</code> (<code>false</code> by default).
        </p>
        <div class="brush: plain">
          <source><![CDATA[
/hippo:configuration/hippo:modules/version-history-cleaner/hippo:moduleconfig:
  default.max.revisions: 3
  default.truncate.ondelete: true
  versionhistorycleanerdemo:eventsdocument.max.revisions: 2
